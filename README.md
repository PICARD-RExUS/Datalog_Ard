# Datalog_Ard
The Data Logging Code for the PICARD Experiment.
Can be optimised to increase sample and record rate.

# Upload to Arduino Procedure
1. Upload EEPROM Reset Program to set EEPROM variable to 0.
2. Ensure Micro-SD Cards are not in Breakout Boards / Remove SD Cards from Breakout boards.
3. Upload Data Logging Code to Arduino
4. Power Down Arduino
5. Insert SD Cards

The next time these arduinos will be active is during the flight of the rocket / testing of the experiment before the flight.
